# Bikesharing


## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to find out if starting a bikesharing business is profitable. Using data from a bikesharing business in New York, analysis is conducted to show the following:
- The length of time bikes are checked out for all riders and gender.
- Number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
- The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Results

### Top Starting Locations

The first image shows the top starting locations in and around New York City. What is clearly seen is the demand for bike sharing services in high density areas like Manhattan. There is less demand for this servies around the city. This could be attributed to many factors. First, people living around the city most likely live in homes and have large families. This means that they are less likely to use bikes to get around. Individuals living in the city core face traffic and congestion everyday, and using bikes can save time getting around the city.

### Average Trip Duration

The image above shows the average trip duration or riders based on their age. The graph shows that younger individuals spend on average more time using the bikesharing servies. This could be attributed to the increasing importance of being fit and looking good. Using the bikesharing service can also be a fun way of spending time in the city with friends as it is easier to get around the city. 

### Checkout Times for Users

Another important factor to consider is the length of time individuals checkout the bikes. The image above shows us that on average, indivudlas use the service for less than 1 hour. This information can be inportant for deciding where to place bike stations as having them too far apart can cause users to overtime be less interesting in using the service since they will need to bike for longer periods of time. This chart shows that users are more intrested in shorter rides and making more frequent stops.

### Checkout Times by Gender

To further analyze the checkout times in the image above, an analysis on checkout times by gender was conducted. The results show that all genders checkout bikes for less than 1 hour, which is similar to the results seen above. What more interesting is the number of rides taken by males. There is a significant difference between the number of rides taken by males than other genders. 

### Trips by Weekday

In order to determine the best times to service the bikes, analysis on the busiest times during the week need to be conducted. The image above shows us that on average the mos topular time is between 6am and 8pm. This is seen everyday. However, 8am and 5pm seem to be the busiest times during the weekday. This can be easily attibuted to the times people go to and leave work. Knowing this, the best time to service the bikes look to be around 2am - 4am any day in the week. 

### Trips be Gender

Once again, the chart above compares the busiest times by gender. It shows that males user the service more frequently than females. The businest hours is the same for both, and both genders use the bike sharing service at the same times as the chart above shows. 

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday

Finally, the last image supports the findings from the previous images. This is that the bike sharing service is heavily domiated by male-identifying subscribers. While there is a demand by female-identifying users, there is a significant difference between males and females. The chart also shows that there are more subscribers than one time users. This is a good sign for the business since it shows that the business can be profitable. 

## Summary
In summary, the images and analysis discussed above show that a bikesharing business is highly profitable in high density metropolitan areas. Areas that face high levels of traffic are the places where stations need to be placed in order to maximize profitability. The analysis on usage by gender shows that the business is composed mainly of male-identifying subscribers. While this is a good sign, it also provides the business with the opportunity to target the female demographic to increase users. the busiest times for this business seem to be in the morning and evening on weekdays when people arrive and leave their offices. 

Two suggestions:
- Traffic data: Data on traffic in neighbourhoods and streets can be valuable. It can help determine the flow of traffice and allow the business to more accurately place stations to increase usage.
- User home location: While this may be a difficult piece of information to gather due to privacy concerns, collecting data on where users live can help determine where to place stations. Providing easy access to bike stations just like bus stations can lead to higher usage.
